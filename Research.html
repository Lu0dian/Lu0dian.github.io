    This study investigates the impact of the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) on LOS and different outcomes in post-acute care (PAC) among traditional Medicare beneficiaries in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs). Using an instrumental variable (IV) approach, we employ PPS-regulated expected length of stay (LOS) as an instrument to assess the causal effects of LOS on various outcomes, including functional improvements, the discharge location, and the probability of successful returning to the community. The analysis leverages data from the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility-Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) for 2019–2020, as well as focusing on key conditions of stroke, hip fractures, cardiac, and joint replacement issues. +In general, our results show that longer LOS is significantly associated with better outcomes. Specifically, longer LOS is significantly associated with improvements in mobility and cognitive function among all conditions. LOS is also significantly associated with a higher likelihood of returning to the community after discharge, particularly for stroke, hip fracture, and cardiac patients. These findings suggest that the PPS-regulated expected LOS indeed changes actual LOS and therefore changes outcomes. These findings highlight the effective role of PPS for optimizing PAC delivery, which can mitigate disparities and improve health equity in PAC settings.<br>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    Regional variation in health care use threatens efficient and equitable resource allocation. Within the Medicare program, variation in care delivery may differ between centrally administered traditional Medicare (TM) and privately managed Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which rely on different strategies to control care utilization. As MA enrollment grows, it is particularly important for program design and long-term health care equity to understand regional variation between TM and MA plans. This study examined regional variation in length of stay (LOS) for stroke inpatient rehabilitation between TM and MA plans in 2019 and how that changed in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed that MA plans had larger across-region variations than TM (SD = 0.26 vs 0.24 days; 11% relative difference). In 2020, across-region variation for MA further increased, but the trend for TM stayed relatively stable. Market competition among all inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) within a region was associated with a moderate increase in within-region variation of LOS (elasticity = 0.46). Policies reducing administrative variation across MA plans or increasing regional market competition among IRFs can mitigate regional variation in health care use.</p>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    <strong>Objectives</strong> Compare post-acute care (PAC) utilization and outcomes in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) between beneficiaries covered by Traditional Medicare (TM) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the previous year.<br>
    <strong>Design</strong> This multiyear cross-sectional study used Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility–Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) data to assess PAC delivery from January 2019 to December 2020.<br>
    <strong>Setting and Participants</strong> Inpatient rehabilitation for stroke, hip fracture, joint replacement, and cardiac and pulmonary conditions among Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older.<br> 
    <strong>Methods</strong> Patient-level multivariate regression models with difference-in-differences approach were used to compare TM and MA plans in length of stay (LOS), payment per episode, functional improvements, and discharge locations.<br>
    <strong>Results</strong> A total of 271,188 patients were analyzed [women (57.1%), mean (SD) age 77.8 (0.06) years], among whom 138,277 were admitted for stroke, 68,488 hip fracture, 19,020 joint replacement, and 35,334 cardiac and 10,069 pulmonary conditions. Before the pandemic, MA beneficiaries had longer LOS (+0.22 days; 95% CI: 0.15–0.29), lower payment per episode (−$361.05; 95% CI: −573.38 to −148.72), more discharges to home with a home health agency (HHA) (48.9% vs 46.6%), and less to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) (15.7% vs 20.2%) than TM beneficiaries. During the pandemic, both plan types had shorter LOS (−0.68 day; 95% CI: 0.54–0.84), higher payment (+$798; 95% CI: 558–1036), increased discharges to home with an HHA (52.8% vs 46.6%), and decreased discharges to an SNF (14.5% vs 20.2%) than before. Differences between TM and MA beneficiaries in these outcomes became smaller and less significant. All results were adjusted for beneficiary and facility characteristics.<br>
    <strong>Conclusions and Implications</strong> Although the COVID-19 pandemic affected PAC delivery in IRF in the same directions for both TM and MA plans, the timing, time duration, and magnitude of the impacts were different across measures and admission conditions. Differences between the 2 plan types shrank and performance across all dimensions became more comparable over time.</p>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    <strong>Objectives</strong> To investigate whether regional variation changes with different beneficiary health insurance coverage types.Design A cross-sectional study of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in 2018 was used.<br>
    <strong>Setting</strong> Medicare beneficiaries only covered by Medicare (group 1) are compared with those covered by Medicare and other health insurance (group 2). Outcomes included healthcare usage measures: (1) whether beneficiaries have a hospital stay and (2) the number for those with at least one stay; (3) whether beneficiaries have a doctor’s visit and (4) the number for those with at least one visit. We compared healthcare usage in both groups across the five regions: (1) New England and Mid-Atlantic; (2) East North Central and West North Central; (3) South Atlantic; (4) East South Central and West South Central; (5) Mountain and Pacific. We used logistic regression for binary outcomes and negative binomial regression for count outcomes in each group.<br>
    Participants We identified 8749 Medicare beneficiaries, of which 4098 in group 1 and 4651 in group 2.<br>
    <strong>Results</strong> Residents in all non-reference regions had a significantly lower probability of seeking a doctor’s visit in group 1 (OR with 95% CI 0.606 (0.374 to 0.982), 0.619 (0.392 to 0.977), 0.472 (0.299 to 0.746) and 0.618 (0.386 to 0.990) in the order of above regions, respectively), which is not significant in group 2. Residents in most non-reference regions (except South Atlantic) had a significantly fewer number of seeking a hospital stay in group 2 (incident rate ratio (IRR) with 95% CI 0.797 (0.691 to 0.919), 0.740 (0.643 to 0.865), 0.726 (0.613 to 0.859) in the order of above regions, respectively), which is not significant in group 1.<br>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong> Regional variation in the likelihood of having a doctor’s visit was reduced in Medicare beneficiaries covered by supplemental health insurance. Regional variation in hospital stays was accentuated among Medicare beneficiaries covered by supplemental health insurance.</p>

    <strong>Summary</strong><br>
    <strong>Background</strong> Prior research provides evidence of implicit and explicit anti-Black prejudice among US physicians. However, we know little about whether racialized prejudice varies among physicians and non-physician healthcare workers relative to the general population.<br>
    <strong>Methods</strong> Using ordinary least squares models and data from Harvard's Project Implicit (2007–2019), we assessed the associations between self-reported occupational status (physician, non-physician healthcare worker) and implicit (N = 1,500,268) and explicit prejudice (N = 1,429,677) toward Black, Arab-Muslim, Asian, and Native American populations, net of demographic characteristics. We used STATA 17 for all statistical analyses.<br>
    <strong>Findings</strong> Physicians and non-physician healthcare workers exhibited more implicit and explicit anti-Black and anti-Arab-Muslim prejudice than the general population. After controlling for demographics, these differences became non-significant for physicians but remained for non-physician healthcare workers (β = 0.027 and 0.030, p < 0.01). Demographic controls largely explained anti-Asian prejudice among both groups, and physicians and non-physician healthcare workers exhibited comparatively lower (β = −0.124, p < 0.01) and similar levels of anti-Native implicit prejudice, respectively. Finally, white non-physician healthcare workers exhibited the highest levels of anti-Black prejudice.<br>
    <strong>Interpretation</strong> Demographic characteristics explained racialized prejudice among physicians, but not fully among non-physician healthcare workers. More research is needed to understand the causes and consequences of elevated levels of prejudice among non-physician healthcare workers. By acknowledging implicit and explicit prejudice as important reflections of systemic racism, this study highlights the need to understand the role of healthcare providers and systems in generating health disparities.</p>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    <strong>Background</strong> The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) is a voluntary social health insurance program launched in 2002 for rural Chinese residents where 80% of people were without health insurance of any kind. Over time, several concerns about this program have been raised related to healthcare utilization disparities for NCMS participants in urban versus rural regions. Our study uses 2015 national survey data to evaluate the extent of these urban and rural disparities among NCMS beneficiaries.<br>
    <strong>Methods</strong> Data for our study are based on the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) for 2015. Our 12,190-patient sample are urban and rural patients insured by NCMS. We use logistic regression analyses to compare the extent of disparities for urban and rural residence of NCMS beneficiaries in (1) whether individuals received any inpatient or outpatient care during 2015 and (2) for those individuals that did receive care, the extent of the variation in the number of inpatient and outpatient visits among each group.<br>
    <strong>Results</strong> Our regression results reveal that for urban and rural NCMS patients in 2015, there were no significant differences in inpatient or outpatient utilization for either of the dependent variables – 1) whether or not the patient had a visit during the last year, or 2) for those that had a visit, the number of visits they had. Patient characteristics: age, sex, employment, health status, chronic conditions, and per capita annual expenditures – all had significant impacts on whether or not there was an inpatient or outpatient visit but less influence on the number of inpatient or outpatient visits.<br>
    <strong>Conclusions</strong> For both access to inpatient and outpatient facilities and the level of utilization of these facilities, our results reveal that both urban and rural NCMS patients have similar levels of resource utilization. These results from 2015 indicate that utilization angst about urban and rural disparities in NCMS patients do not appear to be a significant concern.<br></p>
